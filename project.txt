distorted fingerprint matching

cnn for fingerprint

siamese network matching

distortions:
geometric,partial/occlusion, blur, noise, morphs, adversarial attacks

geometric abuse (rotation, scaling, translations, warping, deformation)

partial (cropping, 15% -> 60% = recognizable, more is unrecognizable)

compression ()

morph (overlay, noise, color filter)

gan based augmentation
cnn image enhancer
